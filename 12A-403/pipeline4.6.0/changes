CASA renamed split2 as split. Updated the following scripts accordingly:
EVLA_pipeline.py      
EVLA_pipe_solint.py
EVLA_pipe_finalcals.py

EVLA_pipe_hanning.py
Using the new mstransform based hanningsmooth. This requires creating a new MS, and replacing the old MS accordingly.
Also, needed to copy the xml files to the hanning smoothed MS for flagcmd to apply the online flags accordingly.
