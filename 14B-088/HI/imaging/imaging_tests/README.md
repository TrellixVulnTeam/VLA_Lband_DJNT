The initial imaging using Arecibo worked well, but there are some issues. Most important of these is the excess of emission (beyond Arecibo) in the resultant cube.

These scripts image a single channel of the VLA HI data varying a number of parameters (including different versions of CASA). Re-running these tests requires (apart from the MS) CASA 4.2.2, 4.3.1, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 to be installed on the system. I've changed each version's command line names to reflect their version (e.g., casa in 4.2.2 becomes casa-4.2.2).
