# VLA_Lband
Scripts and such for my L Band VLA Data

This repo should contain all of the scripts, but there may be bits and pieces that linger [here](https://github.com/e-koch/canfar_scripts) and [there](https://github.com/e-koch/ewky_scripts).

The reduction, imaging, and analysis scripts for [Koch et al. 2018b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018MNRAS.479.2505K/abstract) can be found in the `14B-088/HI` folder. Please cite our paper if you make use of these scripts.

The analysis scripts for [Koch et al. 2018a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018RNAAS...2a..24K/abstract) are summarized in the `paper_oh_maser.py` script. The reduction and imaging scripts can be found in the `14B-088/OH` folder.

The analysis scripts for [Koch et al. 2019](XXX ADD LINK) are available in [m33-hi-co-lwidths](https://github.com/Astroua/m33-hi-co-lwidths).
